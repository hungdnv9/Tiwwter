<center> A little CRUD post-based website built to replace dying Facebook <center>

## Motivation
 This project started as a way to learn Flask web framework, but evolved in something bigger. We are still running into some issues, so feel free to add them to the issues list.

## Build Status
We are very close to intergrating Travis CI so expect build status soon.

## Tech / Frameworks Used
* [Python 3.6 (although versions above 3.6 work too)](https://www.python.org)
* [Flask - Python micro-framework for web development](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [flask_sqlalchemy - SQLAlchemy adaptation to work with Flask web apps](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/sqlalchemy/)
* [gunicorn - Python WSGI HTTP Server ](https://gunicorn.org/)
* [psycopg2 - Binary necessary for SQLAlchemy to work with PostgreSQL](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)

Other addons are referenced in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/isakal/Tiwwter/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## Code Example / API Reference
This web app is package-like structured. That means that every single package/service has its folder in `~/app/` directory and `__init__.py` within its folder. Also, those service are initialized in `~/app/__init__.py` both outside and inside function `create_app()`.<br>
 E.g. error handling is made as its own service/package and it has its own directory `~/app/errors/`. As you can see, `__init__.py` file can be empty. It's there just to signalize the interpreter it's a package. After making it's own separate folder, initialize the package/service in `~/app/__init__.py`.
```cpp
.
|-- LICENSE
|-- Procfile
|-- README.md
|-- app
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- errors
|   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   `-- handlers.py
|   `-- models.py
|
|-- empty_create_db.py
|-- keys.json
|-- manage.py
|-- requirements.txt

```


To make your own service/package, follow this:


```python
# ~/app/__init__.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
service = YourService(app) # app is the flask object that is running
service.init_app() # initializing the package/service once the app starts

#...

def create_app(): # this function is being ran in run.py which starts the server

    app = Flask(__name__)
    service.init_app()
    return app
```


If you are creating new blueprint, please follow this :


```python
#~/app/your_blueprint/routes.py
from flask Blueprint

bp = Blueprint('bp',__name__) # see flask docs to search for other arguments of the Blueprint object
@bp.route("/")
def some_func():
    return render_template('some_file.html')


```


```python
# ~/app/__init__.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
#services are initialized here
from app.your_blueprint import bp # bp is a name of a blueprint you make

app.register_blueprint(bp)

#...

def create_app(): # this function is being ran in run.py which the starts the server

    app = Flask(__name__)
    #services are initialized here
    from app.your_blueprint import bp # bp is a name of a blueprint you make

    app.register_blueprint(bp)

    return app
```
## Tests
Tests are still done manually. **:)**<br>
That will be changed when Travis CI gets implemented.

## How To Use?
To run your own instance of Tiwwter locally, you will have to set some things up first.<br>
```python
#~/app/__init__.py

#...
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = os.environ['TIWWTER_MAIL']
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = os.environ['TIWWTER_PASSWORD']
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ['TIWWTER_DB_URI']
#...
```
As you can see, we need some environment variables. First two aren't needed if you don't want/need mail service to work. Third one is needed if you actually want to run your website locally.<br>
It's URI for the database. It can be either postgres or sqlite. <br>

Then run type this in your terminal of choice:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python empty_create_db.py
python run.py
```
This snippet is pretty much self-explanitory. We install dependencies, run a script that sets our database with all the correct tables and at the end we run the server.

For this, Python version 3.6 or everything above is good.

## Credits
Good job if you read till here! We would like to give credits to some very important people. Such as Corey Schafer and my CS teacher. Corey has a great youtube series explaining how flask works which you can visit [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH).<br>
Pallets Projects are the creators of Flask and modules that Flask is based on. I recommend visiting their discord server [here](https://discord.gg/7g9bd9g).
